# Big Data and Climate Change
Try to find the relationship between weather report data and evidence of climate change, and the relationship between weather report data.
Eventually, try to forecast the weather report, from previous data.</br>
All daily weather report are from [Global Summary of the Day (GSOD)](https://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/cdoselect.cmd?datasetabbv=GSOD&countryabbv=&georegionabbv=)

> This repository is still in progress. I haven't organized it yet, so the scripts break into several parts according to the steps and methods I made. Will be updated sooner or later if I have time or new discovery.

## Things Not Done Yet
- [ ] Raw data from Global Summary of the Day (GSOD), convert _directly_ into SQLite.</br>
Since I import data into database manually first, it still needs script to convert and insert into SQLite automaticlly.
