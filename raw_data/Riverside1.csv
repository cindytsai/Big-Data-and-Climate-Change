The showers continuously developed off the coast, and  moved inland over central portions of Orange County, starting before daybreak on the sixth, and lasting until the early morning hours on the seventh.  Rainfall generally ranged from 4 to 8 inches  across the area, resulting in widespread flooding.  One observer in Mission Viejo reported 10 inches of rain from this event.   The hardest hit area was the coastal plain southwest of the Santa Ana Mountains.  It was the heaviest rain recorded in at least 70 years.  Collapsing hillsides, and raging water, triggered flooding that forced scores of people to flee their homes, while others climbed atop stalled automobiles to escape the rising waters.   A Local State of Emergency was declared, as mud and debris flows damaged hundreds of homes and businesses, and halted transportation.  Storm debris littered the coastline.  Some areas, like the Rhine Channel in Newport Bay, were clogged to the point where they resembled a landfill.  Total damage estimates for the county included $5.6 million to private homes and businesses, and over $12 million to public facilities, and for debris clean-up.  Some heavy rain did spill over the Santa Ana Mountains, resulting in flooding in the community of El Cerrito, in western Riverside County.  Over 4 inches of rain caused moderate to heavy damage to 8 homes and and minor damage to 10 others.  Farther north in the Victor Valley of San Bernardino County, heavy rains caused local flooding in many communities.  Heavy downpours in Adelanto shortly after midnight, flooded an apartment complex, forcing residents to evacuate, and sent a river of mud and water a foot deep running down some streets.  During the evening of the sixth, a pair of teenage lobster fisherman were caught in a storm a mile west of the beach at North Island Naval Air Station.  Swells more than 6 feet high capsized their 18-foot skiff.  They were rescued several hours later with cuts and bruises.",94

Although it was late in the season, this storm was the coldest of the entire winter.  An illegal immigrant died of exposure early on the twenty-ninth.  His body was found in a shed in Jamul.  Snow was reported as low as 2000 feet in the deserts.  In the mountains, 1 to 3 feet of snow fell above 5000 feet, with generally 4 to 8 inches between 3000 and 5000 feet.  Strong winds gusting as high as 60 mph accompanied the snowfall in some areas, resulting in heavy drifting and road closures.  Along the coasts, and in the foothills, scattered showers and thunderstorms on the twenty-ninth produced enough ice pellets and hail to cover the ground one inch deep in some areas.  Considerable damage was reported to flower and strawberry crops, and a 10 car pile-up on the I-15 near Deer Springs sent 5 people to area hospitals.   In a Lake Elsinore neighborhood, an apparent microburst uprooted a tree and ripped two 20-foot sections of roofing tiles from a home.  A funnel cloud was spotted that afternoon near Dulzura.",112
