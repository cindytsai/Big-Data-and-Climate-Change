The last in a series of strong, early season storms brought record heavy rain to the coast and valleys, and dumped two feet of snow at the mountain resorts. This storm sent October rainfall totals to record levels in most locations, and brought a quick end to what could have been another disasterous fire season. San Diego Lindbergh Field ended October with 4.98 inches of rain, making it the wettest October since records began in 1850. Many ski resorts in the San Bernardino Mountains were open by Halloween...something that hadn't happened in over 30 years. The storm caused widespread urban flooding and sent mud and rocks sliding down hillsides and canyons all across the area. Strong thunderstorms also raked across Orange and San Diego counties, bringing even more heavy rain, small hail, and gusty winds. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 2.00 to 4.00 inches or more from the coast to the mountains, and between 0.50 to 1.00 inch in the deserts.

A cold low pressure system known as an inside slider slammed southern California from the north with heavy snow, widespread thunderstorms, and gusty winds. The storm first struck the high desert areas of the Apple and Yucca Valleys bringing with it heavy thundersnow and strong north winds. The cold air then filtered into the inland empire, dropping snow as low as 1000 ft. Residents woke to snow in places like Temecula, Elsinore, and Murrieta. In those places, snow was up to 3 inches deep. The hills surrounding Riverside and Moreno Valley were also coated with a blanket of snow. Snow was so heavy in Yucaipa and Calimesa that large tree limbs came crashing down all across town. The same was true in the mountains, where locals reported upwards of 2 to 3 feet of snow. Wind caused problems all across southern California. Some trees came down on powerlines, cutting power to more than 64,000 southern California Edison customers. In San Diego County, snow was reported as low as Ramona. Even by lunch time, temperatures at the coast were only in the low 40s. Snow lingered on the ground at low elevations for days following the storm as daytime temperatures were slow to recover.",45

Communities in the San Diego mountains were particularly hard hit by the near record snowfall. Roof damage was reported in Guatay and power outages were widespread. One person died and 7 others were injured after their party became lost near Pine Valley during the storm. Numerous traffic accidents forced the closure of most major mountain roads, including I-8, hwy 18, hwy 38, and hwy 243. Snowfall totals ranged from around 1 to 3 feet, including 12" at Pine Valley, 13" at Warner Springs, 25" at Cuyamaca, 27" at Pine Cove and Idyllwild, and 36" at Lake Arrowhead, Big Bear, and the top of the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway. Light snow was also reported in Hemet, Temecula, Devore, Sage, Yucaipa, and Alpine. Post storm visible satellite imagery showed heavy snowfall accumulations as far as 200 miles south of the international border into Baja Mexico.",165

The strong subsidence over Southern California caused an unprecedented heat wave and widespread surface dewpoint temperatures from the upper 60s to the mid 70s resulted in record warm overnight temperatures and abnormally high humidity levels.

Note that because of a lack of detailed historical observations concerning coastal water temperatures, the Storm Data preparer cannot confirm this claim. The heat wave reached its peak on the 22nd. Several all time record highs were tied or broken that day, including 109 at La Mesa, 112 at Escondido, 113 at El Cajon, and 114 at Wild Animal Park. Elsewhere, the temperature rose to 105 in the mountain town of Julian, 114 at Ontario, 120 at Indio and Thermal, and 121 at Palm Springs. San Diego Lindbergh Field reached 99 degrees, becoming the hottest day since September 25, 1989 and the second hottest day ever observed during the month of July.

While high temperatures near the end of the month did not exceed excessive heat criteria, low temperatures remained at record warm levels.

As the main 500 mb low pressure center passed through Nevada, an upstream vort max moved out of Northern California and into the Southern California coastal waters, causing a stronger, secondary 500 mb low pressure center to develop near San Diego. This system was then able to pick up additional moisture as it began to take an over-water trajectory and intensify. The heaviest precipitation was confined to San Diego County where low-level cyclogensis and upper level forcing were strongest. Evaporative cooling and cold air advection caused the temperature to drop steadily throughout the day, and the snow level fell from 5500 feet around sunrise to near 1000 feet by mid day. Only a dusting of snow had been reported through noon, but by 1:00 pm, heavy snow was was falling and sticking across a wide area from Ramona to the Anza Borrego Desert.
