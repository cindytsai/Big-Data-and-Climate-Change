The 29th saw thunderstorms trying to form over the southern San Diego County Mountains, but quickly dissipating without much effect as they drifted off the mountain crests. A disturbance moving through Baja on the 30th produced an active day of thunderstorms over southern California, reaching all the way to the coast with prolific lightning and rainfall for several areas. Lightning sparked a few small fires near Poway and La Mesa. A few reports of roadway flooding and mudslides came in from the Poway and Ramona areas that day.
